# Individual-project
This was a purely analytical individual project for my final year at university. This research was conducted under the supervision of Professor Anthony Peyton.

The aim of this project was to further progress the metal sorting industry by developing a sensor-based system that is able to classify the different classes of non-ferrous metals and address the increased costs associated with such systems using Magnetic Induction Spectroscopy (MIS).
For MIS, a magnetic field is used to induce eddy currents across the sample which generates a secondary magnetic field that is measured by a receiver coil. The impedance of the sample then affects the magnitude and phase of the secondary magnetic field resulting in an impedance spectrum that can be analyzed to determine the material under test.

The report goes through extensive research regarding the use of MIS in sorting systems. The research includes details about how such systems may be able to differentiate and classify the metals as well as the limitations associated. The report then provides a detailed explanation of the methodology used in the project. 
Different software were used such as ANSYS Maxwell to create a digital twin of the system.
